# Flipdish Restaurant Menu

A solution to a Flipdish technical challenge. The app renders a menu from an API. A deployed version is on [Vercel](https://flipdish-technical.vercel.app/)

## Useful Scripts

- `npm install` - install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - run the app locally and go to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
- `npm test` - run test suite

## Developer Notes

I used TanStack Query's select to transform the data from the API, selecting only the necessary data for rendering the requirements.
